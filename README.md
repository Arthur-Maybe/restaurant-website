## ‚ú® Features

* **Elegant Design:** A striking dark mode theme with gold accents for a premium feel.
* **Single-Page Application (SPA) Style:** Uses custom JavaScript for quick, smooth page transitions between sections (`Home`, `Menu`, `Gallery`, `Reserve`) without full page reloads.
* **Interactive Elements:**
    * **Custom Cursor:** A gold dot and outline that provide visual feedback on interactive elements.
    * **3D Hover Effects:** Menu and gallery items tilt and scale on mouse hover.
* **Dynamic Scroll Effects:** Navbar shrinks and gains a background on scroll. (Note: Most parallax effects were intentionally removed for standard scrolling, but the floating particle background remains.)
* **Animated Reservations:** The form submission features a "Processing" state, a "Confirmed" state, and a confetti celebratory effect.
* **Fully Responsive:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices with a collapsing hamburger menu.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Color Palette

The primary colors are controlled in `style.css`. To change the main accent color:

* **Main Gold:** `#d4af37`
* **Lighter Gold/Accent:** `#f4e5c3`
* **Dark Backgrounds:** `#0a0a0a` / `#0f0f0f`

### Page Navigation

All navigation is managed by the `showPage(pageName)` function in `script.js` and the corresponding links in `index.html`.

* To add a new page, create a new `<section class="page" id="[NEW-ID]">` in `index.html` and add a corresponding link: `<a onclick="showPage('[NEW-ID]')">New Link</a>`.

### Removed Parallax Effects

The scroll-based parallax effects for images and the hero section were **commented out** in `script.js` to ensure a standard scrolling experience. If you wish to re-enable them, refer to the commented code block inside the `window.addEventListener('scroll', ...)` function.
